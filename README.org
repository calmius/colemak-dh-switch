Kmonad doesn't work without some permissons and rules out of the box,
this script handles that for you. Additionally it enables layout at startup.

If you have non-systemd init system, [[https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/tree/master/startup][see]]

** Usage
+ Change input device in =colemak-dh-YOURLAYOUT.kbd= file.
  - If you use USB keyboard, search for =*-kbd= device in =/dev/input/by-id/=
  - If you use Laptop keyboard, search for =*-kbd= device in =/dev/input/by-path/=
#+begin_src lisp
  input  (device-file "/dev/input/by-id/YOURDEVICE-kbd")
#+end_src

+ In the =setup.sh=, replace =/path-to= with the full path to =colemak-dh-YOURLAYOUT.kbd=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  CONFIG_FILE="/path-to/colemak-dh-YOURLAYOUT"
#+end_src
